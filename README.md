Hello Universe,

My name is Amelia and I know nothing about Github but I do love space cats.
I love hikes through douglas fir forests, kayaks over moon jellies and feeling the ocean wind on my face.
I also love puzzles, troubleshooting and the art of failing.
Recently I have moved back to my soul land north of San Francisco and am excited to embark on this journey of coding and the architectural design of our virtual ecosystem.

Stay Hungry Stay Foolish,
Amelia
